      <p><b>The product</b> of my web development hobby and my hatred of
      all other social media outlets. I'm hoping I could create a space
      where my friendos can do as they please unlike twitter,
      reddit, anything google, ect. This probably has been attempted more
      times I can count to but I want to make this function differently
      than any other site. To me every social site on the damn web looks
      and acts the same. Mine currently looks like something that got
      hosted in 2003 but everything that this will be is planned and on
      paper. Whether this functionality would even be conventional or
      completely redundant, there are so many ideas on how to do things and
      a lot of them don't make it because of general laziness or fear of
      failure. I don't want mine to have that same fate.</p>

      <p><b>I'm not working almost</b> everyday to reinvent the
      urinary catheter, this is just a fun experiment I could spend a lot
      of my time on.</p>

      <h1>The beginning</h1><br/>
      <img src="pages/img/hyperdistort1.jpg"/>
      <p><b>This all started</b> when I found this group that you can call
      138. Any brain dead normie would call it a &quot;hacker group&quot;,
      but they were really just enthusiasts of computer science, like
      programming and security. Overall, they were super friendly and
      helped me find my purpose in life. As a whole they were
      complete lads, they got me into GNU/Linux and how free software kicks
      ass, below you can find why this part was pretty important. Then
      there was programming. I've always thought programming was neat. you
      are able to have full control over your system by giving it specific
      instructions on how to run a program you made. That aspect was very
      nice but I have always considered it to be too hard and I had no
      motivation. Thats where 138 stepped in and informed me that it's made
      to be easy and anyone with spare time can learn it. It started with a
      good friend known as Rich directed me to a site called
      codecademy.com/, where I learned a little bit of python. It didn't go
      over that great because I was still so new to it, what I mostly
      accomplished was understanding syntax and work flow. thats when
      another good friend known as Trav insisted I'd learn JavaScript. I
      found it easier to learn and figured out how to use it with my
      browser to make it do cool stuff. After a while I made a few static
      pages, then I got into PHP when I wanted to make it more dynamic.
      Then finally Rich pen tested the site and instructed how to make it more secure,
      Trav offered laracast PHP tutorials, I don't use any frameworks but
      it helped me build my own with their examples, and a good friend
      known as Patrickfield supplied miscellaneous help whenever I ran into
      problems. In all, 138 pulled me out of the rut I was stuck in for the
      longest time. Without them this site and my potential career wouldn't
      be a thing, you can find them in the specialthanks page.</p>

      <h1>The now</h1>
      <img src="pages/img/hyperdistort3.jpg"/>
      <p><b>There really is</b> not a lot to say about today. I have
      just been learning and adding/improving the look and feel of my site.
      You will be able to do everything an imageboard would let you do and have
      your own chat circles. But thats probably in the future where I'm
      actually smart enough to use a database properly.</p>

      <h1>The pc market fucking blows</h1>
      <img src="pages/img/main.jpg"/>
      <p><b>GHG explains this whole ordeal better than I can which you can
      find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-rQaWPL66w">here</a>.</b> I
      was a pc enthusiast before this but computer hardware is
      half the battle. There really is nothing wrong with the pc industry
      except it filled with morons or children that really don't know how
      pcs work at all. Its absolute retarded consumerism. I could rant
      about this subject for hours but long story short: The amount of
      virgins thinking they need hyper threading for playing gay ass cs:go,
      they need a 400$ graphics card to render 1080p, or the micro penises
      that still play pubg and blame their computer for not running that
      shitty unoptimized game is awful. Whatever you do, dont buy in to the dick measuring
      contest. It will only help you loose money and give you stress.</p>

      <p><b>I still regret</b> throwing away my original pc I built. it had
      some cheap msi board with an athlon x4 860k, 8gb of hyper x ram, a
      gtx 750ti, 500w corsair psu, and 500Gb of storage all in a nifty
      rosewill ranger-m black case. It was amazing and could do anything
      you wanted it to do. But when I built it I didn't know anything about
      computers and when learning about the hardware I was led to believe
      it sucked. The original parts where retrieved and I might rebuild it
      sometime. The moral of the story I guess is to love the system you
      have and not worry what shitty games it can or cant play well. Focus more on
      what you can create with it instead. Going the &quot;enthusiasts&quot;
      way will never make you happy.</p></p>
